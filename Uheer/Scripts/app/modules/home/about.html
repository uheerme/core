    <h2>About uheer.me</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="/">uheer.me</a> is a awesome place where you can listen to music uploaded by other people or share your own playlist!
        It's ideal for creating silent-disco or throwning low-costing parties, as it plays synchronously in all devices and every
        one can listen to it with their headsets or use their phones as music boxes!
    </p>
    <p>
        uheer.me was created in 2015 and it had its code made available in 2015.

    <h3>How to use it?</h3>
    <p>
        Sign in and go to channels. You can create your own or search for an existing one.
    </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>You've selected an existing channel:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Just seat back and relax. The song will start playing automatically.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>You've created your very own channel:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the dashboard to upload songs and manage your channel.</li>

    <h4>What is an API and why do you guys have it?</h4>
    <p>
        API stands for Application Program Interface and it's the reason why a single web service can synchronize different platforms, like
        web browsers and Android phones. uheer.me has an open API, which means if you are not satisfied with our apps,
        you can create your own and use our service! To understand more how things work, take a look at the <a href="/help">/API's docs</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>How does the synchronization work?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A DJ creates a channel, uploads songs and start one of them.</li>
        <li>Multiple peers visit that DJ's channel.</li>
        <li>
            The server keeps import information about the channel, such as which music is playing and when it has started. Peers' computers
            collect this information and synchronize themselves with the server by executing <code>Christian's algorithm</code> multiple times.
        </li>
        <li>
            Periodically, the peers' computers will estimate how synchronized they are, in comparison to the server. If required,
            they will attempt to improve synchronization by calculating the errors gotten so far and estimating translations
            for the current song, adapting in each cycle.
        </li>
    </ul>
